YCloset offers an online clothes subscription service. Each month, subscribers can access up to 30 items from a catalogue of over 150,000 mid- to high-end clothing options for a subscription fee of CNY 499 (USD 80). YCloset operates in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou and has just received USD 50 million investment from Alibaba, SBCVC, and other companies, to further expand.

Unlike its European and US equivalents, such as Rent the Runway, YCloset offers everyday attire instead of just formal occasion clothing. The value proposition is providing access to a huge variety of clothing so that people can try out new styles regularly without having to make purchases. The target customers are urban white collar women aged 20-35, who face pressure to dress well (even beyond income level) at their workplace.

The key to building a loyal customer base is convenience in delivery and trust in cleaning quality. YCloset is essentially a ‘*wardrobe in the cloud’*, accessed via a smartphone app, and picked up or delivered within a day.

YCloset has joined forces with a leading dry-cleaning company to ensure high quality cleaning of clothes. The company has observed that trendy durable clothes can be used by up to 40 different people. There is also the option to buy the clothes after renting them, a popular choice among customers.
